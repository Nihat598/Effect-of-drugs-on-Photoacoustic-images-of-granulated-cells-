# Effect-of-drugs-on-Photoacoustic-images-of-granulated-cells-
 Photoacoustic imaging and molecular analysis of different therapeutic agents on granulated white blood cells, Eosinophils, in chronic diseases such as asthma, allergy and cancer.

 In this project, we aim to observe the effect of a cancer treatment drug valproic acid (VPA), and an asthma drug montelukast on the Eosinophils, granulated white blood cells that are involved 
 in numerous life-threatening chronic diseases such as asthma, allergy, COPD, and cancer. We do this by Photoacoustic Imaging approaches and compare the results with molecular biology techniques. 
 This way, we will be able to investigate the ability of photoacoustic tomography to capture intracellular events such as granulation.

 In the code, I tried to create the color density maps of all the PA_images with different concentrations of VPA drug to observe if there is change in the intensity of the PA signals. Furtheremore, 
 i applied ANOVA test to see if this change is statistically significant
